# Disaster Tweet Classification

This repo contains code for the Disaster Tweet Classification Kaggle competition which was used for a coding assignment for a Deep Learning Coursera course.

## Problem Description

The problem is to predict which Tweets are about real disasters and which are not. This notebook will be heavily based on the one by Gunes Evitan, which is referenced in the pinned notebook for this Kaggle competition, and will be mainly for my own reference on NLP techniques. 

The data structure is a csv with 5 columns. There is a column for the id of the tweet, the text of the tweet, a keyword from the tweet, and the location the tweet was sent from. The location and keyword may be blank.

The data consists of 7613 tweets, with 3263 tweets for the test set. 

## References

The data cleaning and exploratory data analysis code is heavily taken from Gunes Evitan's pinned notebook for this Kaggle competition. \
